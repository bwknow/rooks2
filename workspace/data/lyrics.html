    <h1>No, thank you</h1>
    <h3>Don Henley</h3>
  </header>
  <p>

Lady Luck's been good to me<br>
I'm as grateful as can be<br>
Never thought this crazy ride would ever last<br>
And though nostalgia is fine, I respectfully decline<br>
To spend my future living in the past<br>
I've been carrying my load down this same old rocky road<br>
Every day I'm getting deeper in a rut<br>
Workin' overtime, now a dollar's worth a dime<br>
And everybody wants a bigger cut<br><br>

No, thank you<br>
I don't think so<br>
You must think I'm blind as a bat<br>
I sure appreciate what you're tryin' to do for me<br>
But I've been there, done that<br><br>

B.S. blaring from the radio, the TV<br>
Hot wind blowin' off The Hill<br>
It's a mystery to me we can't agree to disagree<br>
It's lookin' like we never, ever will<br><br>

Like a drunkard in the night, swingin' left and swingin' right<br>
Republican or Democrat<br>
Well, I ain't got no love for none of the above<br>
cause I've been there, done that<br><br>

No, thank you<br>
I don't think so<br>
It's a little too pat<br>
Don't tell me to take it easy<br>
'Cause I've been there, done that<br><br>

No. thank you<br>
I don't think so<br>
There's nothin' under your hat<br>
No, I won't be in your movie<br>
'Cause I've been there, done that

  <p class="lyrics">
We passed upon the stair, we spoke of was and when<br>
Although I wasn't there, he said I was his friend<br>
Which came as some surprise I spoke into his eyes<br>
I thought you died alone, a long long time ago<br><br>

Oh no, not me<br>
I never lost control<br>
You're face to face<br>
With The Man Who Sold The World<br><br>

I laughed and shook his hand, and made my way back home<br>
I searched for form and land, for years and years I roamed<br>

I gazed a gazely stare at all the millions here<br>
We must have died alone, a long long time ago

Ain't but one way out baby, Lord I just can't go out the door.<br>
Ain't but one way out baby, and Lord I just can't go out the door.<br>

Lord you got me trapped woman, up on the second floor;<br>
If I get by this time I won't be trapped no more.<br>
So raise your window baby, and I can ease out soft and slow.<br>
And lord, your neighbors, no they won't be <br>
Talking that stuff that they don't know.<br><br>

Lord, I'm foolish to be here in the first place,<br>
I know some man gonna walk in and take my place.<br>
Ain't no way in the world, I'm going out that front door<br>

And you, you can be mean<br>
And I, I'll drink all the time<br>
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact<br>
Yes we're lovers, and that is that<br>

Though nothing, will keep us together<br>
We could steal time, <br>

We can be Heroes, for ever and ever<br>

I, I wish you could swim<br>
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim<br>
Though nothing,<br>

We can beat them, for ever and ever<br>
Oh we can be Heroes, <br>

I, I will be king<br>
And you, you will be queen<br>
Though nothing will drive them away<br>
We can be Heroes, just for one dayv
We can be us, just for one day<br><br>

I, I can remember (I remember)<br>
Standing, by the wall (by the wall)<br>
And the guns shot above our heads
(over our heads)<br>
And we kissed, <br>
as though nothing could fall<br>
(nothing could fall)<br>
And the shame was on the other side<br>
Oh we can beat them, for ever and ever<br>
Then we could be Heroes, <br>
just for one day<br><br>

We're nothing, and nothing will help us<br>
Maybe we're lying, <br>
then you better not stay<br>
But we could be safer, 
just for one day

Stealing 'cross the floor<br>
You picked up the receiver<br>

Then you saw the shadow<br>
Steppin' through the door<br><br>

Well don't worry baby<br>
What the world may bring<br>
Well don't worry baby<br>
It won't change a thing<br>
Life is a fly,

Standin' near by the window<br>
Starin' out at the night<br>
You see your lover leanin'<br>
Against the old street light<br>
But don't worry baby<br>
It's gonna be alright<br><br>

Moving like the fog on the Cumberland River<br>
I was leaving on the Delta Queen<br>
And I wasn't ready to go<br>
I'm never ready to go<br>
27 years of nothing but failures and promises that I couldn't keep<br>
Oh lord, I wasn't ready to go<br>
I'm never ready to go<br>
Let it ride<br>
Let it ride easy down the road<br>
Let it ride<br>
Let it take away all of the darkness<br>
Let it ride<br>
Let it rock me in the arms of stranger's angels until it brings me home<br>
Let it ride,  
Let it roll, 
Let it go<br><br>

Loaded like a sailor<br>
Tumbling off a ferry boat<br>
I was at the bar till three<br>
Oh Lord, and I wasn't ready to go<br>
I'm never ready to go<br>
Tennessee's a brother to my sister Carolina where they're gonna bury me<br>
And I ain't ready to go<br>
I'm never ready to go<br>
Let it ride let it ride easy down the road<br>
Let it ride<br>
Let it take away all of this darkness<br>
Let it ride<br>
Let it rock me in the arms of stranger's angels until it brings me home<br>
Let it ride, Let it roll, 
Let it go<br><br>

I wanna see you tonight<br>
Dancing in the endless moonlight<br>
In the parking lot in the headlights of cars<br>
Someplace on the moon<br>
Where they moved the drive-in theater<br>
Where I left the car that I can't find but I still got the keys to<br>
Let it ride<br>
Let it ride easy down the road<br>
Let it ride<br>
Let it take away all of this darkness<br>
Let it ride<br>
Let it rock me in the arms of stranger's angels until it brings me home<br>
Let it ride, Let it roll, Let it go

Love of drink sparkles in his eyes<br><br>

    <h1>Big Sweet Life</h1>
    <h3>Jon Dee Graham</h3>
  </header>
  <p class="lyrics">
Why don't you come outside?<br>
Get a look at that sky<br>
It's like a dream I had one time<br>
Oh, the sky was on fire<br>
Yeah, but that was just a dream<br>
And this real life<br><br>

And it's a big sweet life<br>
It's a big sweet life<br><br>

I had the fear in my legs<br>
And It would not walk<br>
I had the fear in my mouth<br>
It did not want to talk<br>
Yeah, but fear is just a dream<br>
And this is real life<br><br>

And it's a big sweet life<br>
<br>

Come here you beautiful thing<br>
Come here you beautiful everything<br><br>

I had some big ideas<br>
Made some fancy plans<br>
Oh, but I got it all wrong<br>
Man, oh man oh man<br>
Those were only plans<br>
And this is real life<br><br>

It's a big sweet life

    <h1>Big Canal</h1>
    <h3>Jon Dee Graham</h3>
  </header>
  <p class="lyrics">

Up on the bank of a big canal<br>
Watch the water roll by, All by myself<br><br>

The only sound when the high wind blows,<br>
It’s the dry can rattling in the wind like a box of bones.<br><br>

Roll water roll, deep and slow,<br>
She was mine for a little while, but I let her go.<br><br>


I can watch the road from where I sit.<br>
Scratchin pictures in the dirt, with a pointed stick<br><br>

Like a rabbit run, like a bob-white fly<br>
Like a black bird drawing circles in the sky.<br><br>

Roll water roll, green and deep<br>
She was mine for a little while, now she’s yours to keep<br><br>

Roll water roll, green and deep<br>
She was mine for a little while, now she’s yours to keep

    <h1>Dance with me</h1>
    <h3>Old 97s</h3>
  </header>
  <p class="lyrics">

Underneath the foreign stars<br>
In a foreign place where they don't love you, I do tan<br>
In the pale moonlight your eyes are wide<br>
And the band plays, everybody wants you
<br><br>
He takes your hand tenderly<br>
And he whispers sweet surrender, nothing<br>
How he feels about girls like you with your flip flop smiles<br>
And your big blue eyes on vacation<br><br>

[chorus]<br>
Dance with me into the ocean<br>
Roll with me into the sea<br>
Don't tell me the world is in trouble<br>
Do you want to dance with me?<br><br>

Love, changes hands as the big waves<br>
Crash and dream don't die, but I do<br>
Where were you when I needed you right now<br>
The telephone just rings, I'm cannot find you<br><br>

Underneath the foreign sun<br>
With a foreign man who is gone and almost forgotten<br>
Take everything you see<br>
And remember us and wonder If you will be forgiven...

    <h1>Am I Safe</h1>
    <h3>Ryan Adams</h3>
  </header>
  <p class="lyrics">

    All these things keep running through my mind<br>
    Everyone and everything I left behind<br>
    Standing in the cold great dark, watching cars go by<br>
    And all these things keep running through my mind<br><br>
    Am I safe? Am I safe? Am I safe?<br>
    If I don't wanna be with you<br><br>

    Every day my part seems like a stone<br>
    Carries me away into the undertow<br>
    At the bottom, there's no air<br>
    There's no sound, no light<br>
    And all these things keep running through my mind<br><br>

    Am I safe? Am I safe? Am I safe? <br>
    If I don't wanna be with you<br><br>

    On my way back on my sea of part over<br>
    Close my eyes, what if there was nothing<br>
    It's complicated<br>
    I just don't love you anymore<br>
    I just wanna sit here and watch it burn...<br>
    Sit and watch it burn<br><br>

    Sitting look at someone through the world<br>
    Running from myself like when I was a child<br>
    Pictures in on the wall, when we used to smile<br>
    All these things keep running<br>
    Through my mind...

    <h3>Ryan Adams</h3>
  </header>
  <p class="lyrics">
    Love.. when you call my name<br>
    It sends me running into the flame<br><br>

    I love you baby, just treat me right<br>
    Hold me closer in the middle of the night<br>
    I love you girl, and it's alright<br><br>

    Stay with me<br><br>

    Are you waiting, are you standing guard?<br>
    There's nothing they can steal from us<br>
    That isn't always yours<br><br>

    Stay with me, Stay with me<br><br>

    Like the speed of sound, or the speed of light<br>
    When you say my name, it feels so right<br>
    In the middle of the night, when you call my name. 
    Don't worry, it's okay<br><br>

    Stay with me, Stay with me

    <h3>The Backsliders</h3>
  </header>
  <p class="lyrics">

Colder than the pennies on a dead man's eyes<br>
meaner than a four-ten side-by-side<br>

she's the stuff that makes worlds collide<br>
she's a angel with a dangerous side<br><br>

upstairs, razor glidin' on glass<br>
upstairs, some strangers hand on her ass<br>
upstairs, there's a door being closed in the dark<br><br>


well she likes to go riding in her sister's car<br>
hanging out the window wishing on a star<br>

beatin' on the dash when the radio dies<br>
making different boys with the look in her eyes<br><br>

upstairs, her heart's beatin' too fast<br>
upstairs, she swears this one's her last<br>
upstairs, there's a deal going down in the dark<br><br>

maybe in the middle of the night<br>
she'll think about me<br>

something won't hit her quite right<br>
and it won't let her be<br>

darkness comes swimmin' all around her<br>
sleep never follows too soon<br>

I'll be standing out in my front yard<br>
throwin' rocks at the moon...
<br><br>

boys like to dance when that accordion plays<br>
spinnin' her wheels down the lost highway<br>

kickin' up dust on a dancehall floor<br>
leavin' em thirsty beggin' for more<br><br>

upstairs, razor glidin' on glass<br>
upstairs, some strangers hand on her ass <br>
upstairs there's a door being closed in the dark<br>

maybe in the middle of the night<br>
she'll think about me<br>

something won't hit her quite right<br>
and it won't let her be<br>

darkness comes swimmin' all around her<br>
and sleep never follows too soon<br>

I'll be standing out in my front yard<br>
throwin' rocks at the moon<br><br>

throwin' rocks at the moon<br>

    <h1>Snakebit Again</h1>
    <h3>Bernard Allison</h3>
  </header>
  <p class="lyrics">

I did it again, busted and blue<br>
I pushed you to hard, I'm losing you<br>
Your love is a gamble, and I fail everytime<br>
Empty my pockets, and I lose every dime<br><br>

I know our luck is gonna change real soon<br>
I know trouble's gonna win in the end<br>
Whoa, I'm snake bit again<br>
Snake bit again<br>
I can't ever win, trouble's my friend<br>
I'm snake bit again<br><br>

You don't know what cold is, till you lost your will<br>
I gave up my soul baby, but I'm freezing still<br>
I ain't here for forgiveness, just to take the poison away<br>
I'm licking my wounds, I pray everyday<br><br>

I know our luck is gonna change real soon<br>
And I know trouble's gonna win in the end<br>
Oh, I'm snake bit again<br>
Snake bit again<br>
I can't ever win, trouble's my friend<br>
I'm snake bit again

    <h1>Protection</h1>
    <h3>Lucinda Williams</h3>
  </header>
  <p class="lyrics">

I was as God is the witness, a crowdie bar when nobody could hear<br>
Now I travel throw the world with no occasion<br>
And I do, I do it all by my own sweet self<br><br>

I need protection from the power of your love<br>
I need protection from the [?]<br>
I need protection from the [?]<br>
I need protection from the enemy and consciences<br>
Give me protection from the enemy of love<br><br>

I'm be planning to the world all alone<br>
Put you in throw to find a home<br>
I tell you what travel will repeat<br>
My own child make me stay on my two feet<br><br>

I need protection from the power of your love<br>
I need protection from the [?]<br>
I need protection from the [?] of rock and roll<br>
I need protection from the enemy of soul<br>
Give me protection from the coming of love<br><br>

You know the people look at and talk about me<br>
Throw up my hands it's crowd out with<br>
But the world gonna stay, and go without me<br>
So I still get up and I keep on tryn<br>
Living in a world full of endless trouble<br>
Living in a world with darkness double<br>
But my dirty [?] when I stand up<br>
And you forgive what I'm giving for no giving up<br>
<br>

I need protection<br>
Give me protection
